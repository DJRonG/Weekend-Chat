Weekend Home Agent (WHA)

A next-generation, context-aware smart home microservice designed to proactively manage your home environment, media handoffs, and weekend agenda based on physical presence, biometric data, emotional context, and work stress.

üöÄ Features

1. Real-Time Location System (RTLS) & Handoff

Proximity Tracking: BLE RSSI data from watch and phone to determine room location.

Seamless Handoff: Transfers media streams to current room devices via MQTT.

Contextual Lighting: Adjusts brightness and color temperature based on time and ambient light.

Location-Based Suggestions: Recommends nearby food and shopping using Gemini API and Google Search grounding.


2. Contextual Task Generation (Intelligence Core)

Conversation Harvest: Extracts commitments, needs, and emotional state from weekly messages.

Stress & Capacity Filtering: Prioritizes tasks based on sleep, readiness, and work load.

Proactive Planning: Integrates sensor data and social commitments into a consolidated to-do list.


3. International Awareness

Workday Closure Alerts: Monitors European workdays to manage final communications.

Targeted Alerts: Notifies the dashboard when workdays end in monitored zones.
