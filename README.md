Weekend Home Agent (WHA)

A next-generation, context-aware smart home microservice designed to proactively manage the user's home environment, media handoffs, and weekend agenda based on physical presence (RTLS), biometric data, emotional context, and work stress.

üöÄ Core Architectural Imperatives

The WHA is built on three advanced principles, ensuring it remains both autonomous and secure:
Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL): To fulfill the mandate of continuous learning without compromising sensitive data (location, biometrics, finances), all machine learning models must be trained locally on the user's Edge device. Only model weights are transferred, ensuring raw user data never leaves the home network.[1]
Hierarchical Planning & Grounded Execution: To manage the complexity of a multi-day weekend agenda, the LLM utilizes a Hierarchical Planning architecture (inspired by SAGE/HiPlan [2, 3]). This ensures the Agent maintains "macroscopic guidance" (the overall weekend goal) while adapting to real-time changes using dynamic, step-wise prompts (Grounded Execution).[2, 4]
Adaptive Reasoning: The Agent employs Utility-Based Reasoning to weigh complex outcomes (e.g., recovery vs. commitment) and utilizes Zero-Shot Generalization to handle novel requests never explicitly programmed for.[5, 6]

1. Real-Time Location System (RTLS) & Handoff

Proximity Tracking: Uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) RSSI data, requiring an upgrade to Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Sensor Data Fusion (e.g., UWB + IMU) to overcome indoor signal fluctuation issues and ensure robust, high-precision tracking.[7, 8]
Location-Based Suggestions: When the user is outside the home, the Agent uses the Gemini API (with Google Search grounding) to provide relevant suggestions for Food and Shopping near the detected location.

2. Contextual Task Generation (The Intelligence Core)

Stress & Capacity Filtering: Prioritizes the agenda by dynamically factoring in Biometrics, Work Metrics, and Financial Health.
Digital Well-being: Tracks phone usage (YouTube, texting) to calculate a Health Score and Productivity Score, triggering Digital Detox interventions when necessary.

üìù Project Reference Notes

This project is grounded in established architectural patterns from advanced AI systems:
Personalized Data Aggregation (Verily Me): The challenge of securely integrating diverse, longitudinal data (health, schedule, activity) is modeled on systems that connect health and wellness data via standardized frameworks (Apple HealthKit/Google Health Connect).[12]
Privacy-Preserving Learning (FedHome/PPFL): The fundamental ethical constraint of this project‚Äîlearning user behavior without centralizing sensitive data‚Äîis solved by implementing a Cloud-Edge architecture that uses Federated Learning. The raw data remains local to the user's Edge device, and only model weights are shared for global training.[1]
Probabilistic Planning (PExA/Cal.ai): The Agent‚Äôs ability to maximize user utility over efficiency, especially during spontaneous weekend activities, is inspired by intelligent assistants that employ probabilistic reasoning to weigh the complex risks and rewards of different scheduling choices.[13, 14]
LLM Control Flow (SAGE/HiPlan): The Agent's long-horizon planning for the entire weekend is managed by a Hierarchical Planning approach to prevent LLM "disorientation" and ensure actions remain grounded in real-time environmental context.[2, 3, 4]
